# another2048 for the gamebuino classic
## Description
This is another 2048 game for the gamebuino classic. I created this myself because the original form the wiki crashes after a few minutes each time.
## Usage
Just control with the control pad.
Note that at the moment there are no game over screen and no winning screen. If you can't move anymore you lost. If you play beyond 8192 the numbers will overflow the cells. I'm going to fix this soon.
