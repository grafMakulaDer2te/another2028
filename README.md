# another2048 for the Gamebuino Meta
## Description
This is a port of my 2048 game from the Gamebuino Classic to the Gamebuino Meta.
For the Gamebuino Classic I created this myself because the original from the wiki does not work properly for me.
## Setup
Copy the another2028 folder onto your Gamebuino SD-card.
## Usage
Just control it with the D-pad.
If you play beyond 8192 the message "Victory!" appears to prevent the numbers from overflowing the cells.
Note that at the moment there is no game-over screen. If you can't move anymore then you have lost. I'm going to change it soon. Restart by pressing B.
